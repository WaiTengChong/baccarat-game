# Baccarat Game Simulator - Backend Refactored

A high-performance Baccarat game simulator that has been refactored to handle large-scale simulations by moving game logic to the backend. This application can now efficiently process thousands of games without frontend performance issues.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Backend-Powered Simulations**: All game logic runs on the backend for optimal performance
- **Large-Scale Processing**: Handle 10,000+ games with 70 hands each without crashes
- **Real-Time Progress Tracking**: Live progress updates during simulations
- **Temporary Database**: In-memory data storage that auto-cleans on app restart
- **Complete Baccarat Rules**: Accurate implementation of standard Baccarat rules including third-card logic
- **Modern UI**: React-based frontend with Ant Design components
- **Electron Ready**: Desktop application support

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Before Refactoring
```
Frontend (React) -> All game logic -> Display results
```
**Issues**: Memory crashes on large simulations, UI freezing

### After Refactoring
```
Frontend (React) -> API calls -> Backend (Node.js) -> SQLite (Temporary) -> Results
```
**Benefits**: Scalable, responsive UI, efficient memory usage

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- SQLite3

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone and Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install server dependencies
cd server
npm install

# Install client dependencies
cd ../client
npm install
```

### 2. Start the Backend Server

```bash
cd server
npm run dev
# Server starts at http://localhost:3001
```

### 3. Start the Frontend

```bash
cd client
npm start
# Frontend starts at http://localhost:3000
```

## 🎮 Usage

### Basic Simulation

1. **Configure Simulation Parameters**:
   - **SHOES數**: Number of card decks (6, 7, or 8)
   - **運行**: Number of simulation runs (1-5)
   - **局數**: Games per run (1-100,000)
   - **手**: Hands per game (1-70)

2. **Start Simulation**: Click the "運行" (Run) button

3. **Monitor Progress**: Watch the real-time progress bar and status updates

4. **View Results**: Click on completed simulation cards to view detailed results

### Large-Scale Simulation Example

For testing performance with large datasets:
- Set 運行 to 1
- Set 局數 to 10,000
- Set 手 to 70
- This will simulate 700,000 individual hands

## 🔧 API Endpoints

### Start Simulation
```http
POST /api/simulations
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "plays": 1,
  "gamesPerPlay": 100,
  "handsPerGame": 70,
  "deckCount": 8
}
```

### Get Simulation Status
```http
GET /api/simulations/{simulationId}/status
```

### Get Simulation Results
```http
GET /api/simulations/{simulationId}/results
```

### Get Game Hands
```http
GET /api/games/{gameId}/hands
```

## 🗄️ Database Schema

### Temporary SQLite Tables

**simulations**
- id (TEXT): Unique simulation identifier
- plays, games_per_play, hands_per_game, deck_count (INTEGER)
- status (TEXT): 'running', 'completed', 'error'
- progress (INTEGER): 0-100

**games**
- id (INTEGER): Primary key
- simulation_id (TEXT): Foreign key
- play_number, game_number (INTEGER)
- banker_wins, player_wins, tie_wins (INTEGER)
- banker_pairs, player_pairs (INTEGER)

**hands**
- id (INTEGER): Primary key
- game_id (INTEGER): Foreign key
- hand_number (INTEGER)
- result (TEXT): 'Player', 'Banker', 'Tie'
- player_total, banker_total (INTEGER)
- player_cards, banker_cards (TEXT): JSON arrays
- banker_pair, player_pair (BOOLEAN)

## ⚡ Performance Optimizations

### 1. Database Cleanup
- Temporary database is automatically deleted on app restart
- No persistent data between sessions

### 2. Memory Management
- Streaming data processing
- Chunked result loading
- Efficient JSON serialization

### 3. Asynchronous Operations
- Non-blocking simulation execution
- Real-time progress updates
- Responsive UI during processing

### 4. Worker Threads (Optional)
For extremely large simulations, the system includes worker thread support:

```javascript
// Example: Using worker threads for parallel processing
const { Worker } = require('worker_threads');
const worker = new Worker('./simulationWorker.js', {
  workerData: { playNumbers, gamesPerPlay, handsPerGame, deckCount }
});
```

## 🎯 Baccarat Rules Implementation

### Card Values
- Ace = 1
- 2-9 = Face value
- 10, J, Q, K = 0

### Hand Totals
- Sum of card values modulo 10
- Natural win: 8 or 9 on first two cards

### Third Card Rules
#### Player
- Draws if total ≤ 5
- Stands if total ≥ 6

#### Banker
Complex rules based on player's third card and banker's total

### Pair Detection
- Banker Pair: First two banker cards have same value
- Player Pair: First two player cards have same value

## 🛡️ Error Handling

### Backend
- Comprehensive try-catch blocks
- Database transaction rollbacks
- Graceful simulation failure handling

### Frontend
- Network error handling
- User-friendly error messages
- Automatic retry mechanisms

## 📊 Monitoring & Logging

### Real-Time Updates
- Progress percentage
- Hands processed
- Estimated completion time

### Terminal Logging
- Simulation start/completion
- Error tracking
- Performance metrics

## 🔄 Development Workflow

### Running in Development

1. **Backend**: `cd server && npm run dev`
2. **Frontend**: `cd client && npm start`
3. **Both**: Use separate terminals for concurrent development

### Building for Production

```bash
# Build client
cd client && npm run build

# Start production server
cd server && npm start
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **CORS Errors**
   - Ensure backend server is running on port 3001
   - Check that cors middleware is properly configured

2. **Database Lock Errors**
   - Restart the backend server
   - Temporary database will be recreated

3. **Memory Issues**
   - Reduce simulation size
   - Ensure adequate system memory

4. **Port Conflicts**
   - Backend: Change PORT in server/index.js
   - Frontend: Use different port via environment variable

### Performance Tips

1. **For Large Simulations (>1000 games)**:
   - Use smaller batch sizes
   - Monitor system resources
   - Consider running during off-peak hours

2. **For Development**:
   - Use smaller test datasets
   - Enable verbose logging for debugging

## 📈 Scalability Considerations

### Current Limits
- **Single Instance**: ~100,000 games efficiently
- **Memory Usage**: ~500MB for 10,000 games
- **Processing Time**: ~30 seconds for 10,000 games

### Future Enhancements
- Redis for distributed caching
- Worker thread pools
- Horizontal scaling with multiple server instances
- Real-time WebSocket updates

## 💡 Tips for Large Simulations

1. **Start Small**: Test with 100 games before scaling up
2. **Monitor Resources**: Watch CPU and memory usage
3. **Progressive Loading**: Results load as simulation completes
4. **Batch Processing**: Large simulations are processed in chunks
5. **Cleanup**: Database auto-cleans to prevent storage issues
